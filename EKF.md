# Linear Extended Kalman Filter

 - This function describes filtration and poeses estimation in vessel dynamics and kinematics systems. 
 
 - Nonlinear observers and estimators have to be initially modeled such that the vessel model is observable and controllable. 
 
 - The discrete-time Extended Kalman filter for the multivariable system of vessel motion control is designed based on the **Nonlinear model**  estimate the poses
 
First of all, let's define the EKF-localization states as follows:
