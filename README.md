# Problem statement

  - Design, simulate, as well as possibly build and test, an autonomous water buoy that uses GPS and on-board motors to perform tracking <br/>
 
    designed trajectories in the presence of environmental disturbances including wind and wave.
 
  - Software programming in MATLAB was used to simulate and test the design of the USV control system
 
  - The project is assumed to be operated under the general condition of a slight sea state generated by statistical algorithms such that <br/>
 
    simulation results are presented to analyze how the vessel can overcome disturbance challenges.
 
# USV modelling

  - Heron M300 acts as the main USV platform adapted to software simulation.
    
  - A twin-hull and pontoon-style vessel for aquatic research. 
    
  - Heron M300 is assumed to mitigate the heave, pitch, and roll response of the payload tray when the Heron M300 performs tasks on the <br/>
 
    water surface for simplifying system identification
